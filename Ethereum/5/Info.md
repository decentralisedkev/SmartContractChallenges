**Required Methods / Templates** : 

**Required IDE / Framework** : Remix

**Difficulty** : 2.8 / 5

**Gas requirements** : None

**Description**: 

                - This is a smart contract that allows two players to play rocks, paper, scissors.
                - Players will submit an agreed upon amount, when they make their choice.
                - If player one submits a choice, player two could then look at the blockchain and check. A solution will be needed to circumvent this.
               
 **Submission**:
              - In order to submit, create a folder with your name or an alias and upload a .Sol/.txt file
              
**Hint**: Players will need a way to commit to a choice on the blockchain, without revealing their choice. Hashing could help.
