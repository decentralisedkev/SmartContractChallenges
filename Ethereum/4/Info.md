**Description**: 

                - This is a smart contract that adds interest onto your initial balance.
                - Upon initialising, the owner will pay in an initial balance to the contract.
                - For every minute that the initial balance is in the contract, the amount increases by one percent.
                - The owner can only ever withdraw 90% of the contracts total balance at once.
               
 **Submission**:
              - In order to submit, create a folder with your name or an alias and upload a .Sol/.txt file
              
Hint: Time does not need to be accurate and the the balance should not be the contract balance.
